  <section>
<p>The Image Builder project builds Fedora and RHEL operating system images, as
such its test infrastructure is reliant on RPM package repositories to verify
previously succeeding builds do not fail with newer Image Builder updates. It
is not unusual for CI systems to require external resources, but in the case
of RPM repositories we are suddenly confronted with a moving target: If a test
fails, was it our Image Builder modification that broke, or does the RPM
repository include broken updates?</p>
